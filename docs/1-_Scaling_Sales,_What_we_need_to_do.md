# üìà 1- Scaling Sales, What we need to do?

# Intro

To Scale sales we need both a sales strategy but we also need to be ready for the sales and have the ability to scale sales quickly


# Issues

**Onboarding Clients**
Right now we have an issue that we cannot onboard a new client easily, we need to make allot of training, we need to manually create customers and we need to update settings ourselves like increases users etc.

**Lack of time for Neal to run a sales initiative**
Neal has a lack of time as he is pulled into various topics
Most of Neals time is now spent on managing the app topics, updates, testing, ideas, documentation so adding a Product Manager would be the best idea.

**Studio Resource**
We need a way to be able to expand the team quickly, ideas include freelancers, partner 3d studios etc


# Sales
1. Find Clients that do not need loads of studio work to avoid the studio work backlog
2. Social Media advertising, all industries
3. Linked in Targeted Sales
4. Use companies that find prospects and take a commission
5. MTA digital google advertising, very targeted keywords
6. Website Blog
7. Update Website content, look at making the page better
8. Sharing System
9. Referral commission, 1 month commission



# MX Software
## Custom Sites and Apps for Clients
1. MX Software (Mimeeq/Xcactus) - a sister company to Xcactus and Mimeeq
    1. Xcactus provides the dev team
    2. Mimeeq provides the sales
    3. Build full custom back and front ends
        1. Integrated with Mimeeq 
        2. Also can be stand alone projects
    4. Build headless sites using strapi/Next.js
        1. Allows for more cost effective sites for the likes of a company looking for simple sites
        2. Could be used for parts of the 
    5. Custom integrations 
    6. Build UI for Mimeeg apps
        1. ‚ùì Should this work be done by Mimeeq or MX
            1. I think this depends on if this is done using rhe SDK or as an JS embed Lib
                1. If JS embed lib, Mimeeq will have to bundle this and use this for the specific client,
                2. If we do it via the SDK then this code is owned by the client and i think it should be done through MX


## Considerations for MX Software
1. SEO Exspereince https://strapi.io/blog/headless-cms-strapi-seo-best-practices
2. We should stay away from complex commerce work, that can be done easiely with the likes of shopify, we would do projects that were more uniwue like booxerworld.com
3. MX Software


# Key Ideas to Overcome Onboarding
1. Templates, by having templates we can quickly add a new customer with all the settings prepared like stages, default roles etc.
2. Customer Setup Questions: When setting up a customer we need to add the core things like name, address, base currency etc, we need to prepare a list of these.
3. Better UI for Settings - Names, Layout and also hyperlinks from things like quotations
4. Articles and Help throughout the app, by having this in all places we can just direct the customer to each article for each section be it setting up a product or creating a quote
    1. Make Articles both written and Video based so you can pick the one you want, in some case only written will be required.
5. Guided Tours: Look at guided tour software for various parts of the app, perfect for new customer, to walk them through things.
6. Using Email Marketing and Everything GIST has to offer to make Onboarding new customers seamless, they get emails with key features etc
7. Billing: All things like users, product count, usage, revisions etc are set manually, we will need to 
8. Forum/Community Software - https://www.discourse.org/features 
    this will allow people to ask questions and for other to answer, this would likely be a 2023 feature
9. 


## Guided Tours
1. After First log in on the business panel page
    1. If they have business panel only focus on this, if they have admin show switching to the admin panel.
2. Modular & Standard Configurators: This will be perfect for showing the various functions of the, how to add a product, finish screen, share a scene, additional options menu etc.

## Email Automation for Onboarding New Clients
1. We need to add all new users into a Automation Email
2. We can do this manually, adding them in, we should set up an automation for checking for new app users Tier1‚Äôs so that i get an email when a user signs up
3. Then we can add them into the email automation
4. the email automation will be different depending on the type of user they are
5. 
6. Send them an email about getting started with Quotations
7. Send them an email about Adding products
    1. Adding a Product
    2. Active and Inactive
    3. Creating Product Categories
    4. Related Products
    5. Tabs
    6. Delivery Info
    7. Product Categories
8. Making Embed, Important Info
9. Working with EVO-X, how it works, settings required like Basket Support
10. To make it quick to set up a customer we should add customer templates to the app




## Key Software Things
1. Stability, Datadog or similar for tracking issues before they happen
2. Releases, make them stable and seamless so we can update mid day and switch to the 2nd data centre, make the update and then switch the traffic back.
3. US and UK sites for better speed for US clients
