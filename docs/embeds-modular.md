title: Modular Configurator
---

## Get started

Generate code snippet under Admin Panel -> Product -> Copy Embed Code (button).

## Usage

This embed is available in modal-only view, which means that you need to enable it. There are two possible ways to achieve this.

1. By using `data-mimeeq-render-at-mount` attribute on `data-mimeeq` element. This will enable modal immediately after page load.
2. By firing `mimeeq-show-modular` event on your `document`. This allows you to enable it on demand but requires a bit of coding on host site. You can find full example [here](/guides-modular).

## Parameters

When you generate the code snippet, you can customize things like:

- disabling UI elements
- changing localization
- customizing brand colors
- customizing font
- customizing display style

## Example code

```html
<div data-mimeeq data-mimeeq-short-code="E3AN1J" data-withhistory data-locale="en"></div>
<script src="https://jrdgrq09nk.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/api/cpq/get-embed-short-code-data?shortCode=E3AN1J&html=1" rel="script" type="application/javascript" async></script>
```

## Open Finish Screen

In case you are using modular configurator with enabled History Navigation you can open Summary Modal by default while loading shared url.
To do that you need to append `&finishScreen=1` to your URL.

Example url should look like this 

`https://stagingembed.mimeeq.co.uk/products-sixteen3/?isModular=true&variantCode=CALMOD&shortCode=1TXDJI&finishScreen=1`
